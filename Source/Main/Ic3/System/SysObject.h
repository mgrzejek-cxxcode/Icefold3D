		/// - when called for a Window, it acts as if the window has been closed (usually via EvtWindowUpdateDestroy),
		/// - when called for an OpenGLRenderContext, it flushes commands, unbinds the context and destroys it,
		/// - for both cases (Window and OpenGLRenderContext) removes them from being active event sources.

		/// invoked when the last handle of an object goes out of scope and before calling this object's destructor.
		/// This method itself IS NOT a part of the dtor! Of course this fact automatically implies the following things:
