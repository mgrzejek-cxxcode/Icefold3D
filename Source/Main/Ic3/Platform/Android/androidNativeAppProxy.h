/**
 * The native activity interface provided by <android/native_activity.h>
 * is based on a set of application-provided callbacks that will be called
 * by the Activity's main thread when certain events occur.
 *
 * This means that each one of this callbacks _should_ _not_ block, or they
 * risk having the system force-close the application. This programming
 * model is direct, lightweight, but constraining.
 *
 * The 'android_native_app_glue' static library is used to provide a different
 * execution model where the application can implement its own main event
 * loop in a different thread instead. Here's how it works:
 *
 * 1/ The application must provide a function named "android_main()" that
 *    will be called when the activity is created, in a new thread that is
 *    distinct from the activity's main thread.
 *
 * 2/ android_main() receives a pointer to a valid "AndroidAppState" structure
 *    that contains references to other important objects, e.g. the
 *    ANativeActivity obejct instance the application is running in.
 *
 * 3/ the "AndroidAppState" object holds an ALooper instance that already
 *    listens to two important things:
 *
 *      - activity lifecycle events (e.g. "pause", "resume"). See APP_CMD_XXX
 *        declarations below.
 *
 *      - input events coming from the AInputQueue attached to the activity.
 *
 *    Each of these correspond to an ALooper identifier returned by
 *    ALooper_pollOnce with values of LOOPER_ID_MAIN and LOOPER_ID_INPUT,
 *    respectively.
 *
 *    Your application can use the same ALooper to listen to additional
 *    file-pdesc.  They can either be callback based, or with return
 *    identifiers starting with LOOPER_ID_USER.
 *
 * 4/ Whenever you receive a LOOPER_ID_MAIN or LOOPER_ID_INPUT event,
 *    the returned data will point to an AndroidPollSource structure.  You
 *    can call the process() function on it, and fill in AndroidAppState->onAppCmd
 *    and AndroidAppState->onInputEvent to be called for your own processing
 *    of the event.
 *
 *    Alternatively, you can call the low-level functions to read and process
 *    the data directly...  look at the process_cmd() and process_input()
 *    implementations in the glue to see how to do this.
 *
 * See the sample named "native-activity" that comes with the NDK with a
 * full usage example.  Also look at the JavaDoc of NativeActivity.
